# Matrix

Hello everybody! I am a newbie in programming, so this is my first project ever. I'd like to introduce you my own class Matrix which had been written in C++.
My class include:
- create function;
- get function;
- check function;
- check if odd or even;
- erase function;
- operator +, -, =;
- random Filling function;
- displaying Rows and Columns;
- erasing Rows and Columns;
- matrix Loop, where you can implement functions below in one while loop.

Sooner I am going to deal with operator * and /, because it's realisation is quiet hard to me for now.

Thanks for using my class in advance!
