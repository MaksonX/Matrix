# Matrix

Hello everybody! I am a newbie in programming, so this is my first project ever. I'd like to introduce you my own class Matrix which had been written in C++.
My class include:
- create function;
- get function;
- check function;
- check if odd or even;
- erase function;
- operator +, -, =.

Sooner I am going to deal with operator * and /, because it's realisation is quiet hard to me for now.

Download my hedaer file "Matrix.h" and have fun.

Thanks for using my class in advance!
